"""
Main Execution Script for MedMNIST Classification Pipeline

This orchestrator manages the lifecycle of a deep learning experiment, applying 
an adapted ResNet-18 architecture to various MedMNIST datasets.

The pipeline follows a 5-stage orchestration logic:
1. Environment Initialization: Centralized setup via RootOrchestrator, 
   handling seeding, resource locking, and directory management.
2. Data Preparation: Metadata-driven loading, creation of robust DataLoaders, 
   and visual diagnostic sampling of augmented images.
3. Training Execution: Standardized training loops with AMP, MixUp, and 
   automated checkpointing of the best model based on validation metrics.
4. Model Recovery & Testing: Restoration of optimal weights and comprehensive 
   evaluation including Test-Time Augmentation (TTA).
5. Reporting & Summary: Generation of diagnostic visualizations, structured 
   Excel performance reports, and finalized session logging.
