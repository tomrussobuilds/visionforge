"""
Main Execution Script for MedMNIST Classification Pipeline

This orchestrator manages the lifecycle of a deep learning experiment, applying 
an adapted ResNet-18 architecture to various MedMNIST datasets (e.g., BloodMNIST). 

Key Pipeline Features:
1. Dynamic Configuration: Metadata-driven setup (mean/std, classes, channels) 
   leveraging a centralized Dataset Registry.
2. Root Orchestration: Centralized environment setup via RootOrchestrator 
   (seeding, locking, directory management, and logging).
3. Data Management: Handles automated loading, subset mocking for testing, 
   and robust PyTorch DataLoader creation with configurable augmentations.
4. Model Orchestration: Factory-based initialization of specialized architectures.
5. Training & Recovery: Executes standardized training loops with automated 
   checkpointing of the best model based on validation performance.
6. Comprehensive Evaluation: Performs final testing with Test-Time Augmentation (TTA), 
   generates diagnostic visualizations (Confusion Matrices, Loss Curves), and 
   exports structured performance reports.
