"""
EfficientNet-B0 Architecture for 224x224 Medical Imaging.

Adapts EfficientNet-B0 (compound scaling architecture) for medical image
classification with transfer learning support. Handles both RGB and grayscale
inputs through dynamic first-layer adaptation.

Key Features:
    - Efficient Scaling: Balances depth, width, and resolution
    - Transfer Learning: Leverages ImageNet pretrained weights
    - Adaptive Input: Customizes first layer for grayscale datasets
    - Channel Compression: Weight morphing for 1→3 channel promotion

    Constructs EfficientNet-B0 adapted for medical imaging datasets.

    Workflow:
        1. Load pretrained weights from ImageNet (if enabled)
        2. Modify first conv layer to accept custom input channels
        3. Apply weight morphing for channel compression (if grayscale)
        4. Replace classification head with dataset-specific linear layer
        5. Deploy model to target device (CUDA/MPS/CPU)

    Args:
        device: Target hardware for model placement
        num_classes: Number of dataset classes for classification head
        in_channels: Input channels (1=Grayscale, 3=RGB)
        cfg: Global configuration with pretrained/dropout settings
