Custom Loss Functions Module

This module implements advanced objective functions for computer vision tasks,
extending standard PyTorch criteria. It includes specialized losses like 
Focal Loss to handle extreme class imbalances and difficult samples 
often encountered in medical imaging and fine-grained classification.

    Implementation of Focal Loss for multi-class classification.
    
    Focal Loss reshapes the standard Cross Entropy loss such that it 
    down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified (easy) examples, 
    focusing the model's learning on hard, misclassified samples.

    Formula:
        Loss = -alpha * (1 - pt)^gamma * log(pt)
        where pt is the probability of the true class.

    Attributes:
        gamma (float): Focusing parameter. Higher values reduce the relative 
            loss for well-classified examples (default: 2.0).
        alpha (float): Balancing parameter for class importance.

            each class.
