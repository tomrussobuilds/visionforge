"""
Filesystem Authority and Path Orchestration Package.

This package centralizes all path-related logic for the MedMNIST pipeline.
It provides a dual-layer approach:
1. Static: Project root and global directory constants via 'constants'.
2. Dynamic: Experiment-specific directory management via 'RunPaths'.
