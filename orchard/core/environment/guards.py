"""
Process & Resource Guarding Utilities.

Provides low-level OS abstractions to manage Python script execution
in multi-user or shared environments. It ensures system stability
and safe resource usage by offering:

- **Exclusive filesystem locking** (`flock`) to prevent concurrent runs
  and protect against disk or GPU/MPS conflicts.
- **Duplicate process detection and optional termination** to free
  resources and avoid interference.

These utilities ensure each run is isolated, reproducible, and safe
even on clusters or shared systems.
