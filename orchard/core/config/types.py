"""
Semantic Type Definitions & Validation Primitives.

Foundational type-system for the configuration engine. Leverages Pydantic's
Annotated types and Functional Validators to enforce domain-specific
constraints (probability ranges, learning rate boundaries, path integrity)
before reaching orchestration logic.

Core Responsibilities:
    * Path sanitization: Resolves paths to absolute forms with home directory
      expansion (~), ensuring consistency without disk I/O
    * Boundary enforcement: Strict validation of hyperparameters (LR,
      probabilities, smoothing) using field constraints to prevent unstable states
    * Type aliasing: Centralized registry of domain-specific types (WorkerCount,
      ProjectSlug, LearningRate) for semantic consistency
    * Serialization policy: Custom serialization for complex objects (Path)
      ensuring JSON/YAML compatibility

Catches invalid states at application edge during schema initialization,
preventing runtime failures in deeper orchestration layers.

    Resolve path to absolute form without disk side-effects.

    Expands user home directory (~) and converts to absolute path
