"""
Experiment Lifecycle Orchestration.

This module provides RootOrchestrator, the central coordinator for experiment
execution. It manages the complete lifecycle from configuration validation to
resource cleanup, ensuring deterministic and reproducible ML experiments.

Architecture:
    - Dependency Injection: All external dependencies are injectable for testability
    - 7-Phase Initialization: Sequential setup from seeding to environment reporting
    - Context Manager: Automatic resource acquisition and cleanup
    - Protocol-Based: Type-safe abstractions for mockability

Key Components:
    RootOrchestrator: Main lifecycle controller

Related Protocols (defined in their respective modules):
    InfraManagerProtocol: config/infrastructure_config.py
    ReporterProtocol: logger/reporter.py
    TimeTrackerProtocol: environment/timing.py

Typical Usage:
    >>> from orchard.core import Config, RootOrchestrator, parse_args
    >>> args = parse_args()
    >>> cfg = Config.from_args(args)
    >>> with RootOrchestrator(cfg) as orchestrator:
    ...     device = orchestrator.get_device()
    ...     paths = orchestrator.paths
    ...     # Run training pipeline via forge.py phases

# ROOT ORCHESTRATOR
class RootOrchestrator:
    """
    Central coordinator for ML experiment lifecycle management.

    Orchestrates the complete initialization sequence from configuration validation
    through resource provisioning to execution readiness. Implements a 7-phase
    initialization protocol with dependency injection for maximum testability.

    The orchestrator follows the Single Responsibility Principle by delegating
    specialized tasks to injected dependencies while maintaining overall coordination.
    Uses the Context Manager pattern to guarantee resource cleanup even during failures.

    Initialization Phases:
        1. Determinism: Global RNG seeding (Python, NumPy, PyTorch)
        2. Runtime Configuration: CPU thread affinity, system libraries
        3. Filesystem Provisioning: Dynamic workspace creation via RunPaths
        4. Logging Initialization: File-based persistent logging setup
        5. Config Persistence: YAML manifest export for auditability
        6. Infrastructure Guarding: OS-level resource locks (prevents race conditions)
        7. Environment Reporting: Comprehensive telemetry logging

    Dependency Injection:
        All external dependencies are injectable with sensible defaults:
        - infra_manager: OS resource management (locks, cleanup)
        - reporter: Environment telemetry engine
        - log_initializer: Logging setup strategy
        - seed_setter: RNG seeding function
        - thread_applier: CPU thread configuration
        - system_configurator: System library setup (matplotlib, etc)
        - static_dir_setup: Static directory creation
        - config_saver: YAML persistence function
        - device_resolver: Hardware device detection

    Attributes:
        cfg (Config): Validated global configuration (Single Source of Truth)
        infra (InfraManagerProtocol): Infrastructure resource manager
        reporter (ReporterProtocol): Environment telemetry engine
        time_tracker (TimeTrackerProtocol): Pipeline duration tracker
        paths (RunPaths): Session-specific directory structure
        run_logger (logging.Logger): Active logger instance for session
        repro_mode (bool): Strict determinism flag
        num_workers (int): DataLoader worker processes

    Example:
        >>> cfg = Config.from_args(args)
        >>> with RootOrchestrator(cfg) as orch:
        ...     device = orch.get_device()
        ...     logger = orch.run_logger
        ...     paths = orch.paths
        ...     # Execute training pipeline with guaranteed cleanup

    Notes:
        - Thread-safe: Single-instance locking via InfrastructureManager
        - Idempotent: initialize_core_services() is safe to call multiple times
          (subsequent calls return cached RunPaths without re-executing phases)
        - Auditable: All configuration saved to YAML in workspace
        - Deterministic: Reproducible experiments via strict seeding
