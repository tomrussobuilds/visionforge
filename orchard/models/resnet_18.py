ResNet-18 Multi-Resolution Architecture.

Adaptive ResNet-18 that works at both 28x28 (low-resolution) and 224x224
(high-resolution) with resolution-specific architectural modifications.

Resolution-Specific Adaptations:
    28x28:
        - 7x7 Conv1 → 3x3 Conv1 (stride 1 instead of 2)
        - MaxPool removed (prevents 75% spatial loss)
        - Weight morphing via bicubic interpolation
    224x224:
        - Standard ResNet-18 stem (7x7 Conv1, stride 2, MaxPool)
        - Only channel adaptation for grayscale inputs

    Constructs ResNet-18 with resolution-aware architectural adaptation.

    At 28x28, performs stem surgery to preserve spatial resolution.
    At 224x224, uses the standard ResNet-18 architecture.

    Workflow:
        1. Load ImageNet pretrained ResNet-18 (if enabled)
