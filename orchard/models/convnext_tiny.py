"""
ConvNeXt-Tiny Architecture for 224x224 Image Classification.

Adapts ConvNeXt-Tiny (modernized ConvNet architecture) for image
classification with transfer learning support. Handles both RGB and grayscale
inputs through dynamic first-layer adaptation.

Key Features:
    - Modern ConvNet Design: Incorporates design choices from transformers
    - Transfer Learning: Leverages ImageNet pretrained weights
    - Adaptive Input: Customizes first layer for grayscale datasets
    - Channel Compression: Weight morphing for RGB→grayscale adaptation

    """
    Constructs ConvNeXt-Tiny adapted for image classification datasets.

    Workflow:
        1. Load pretrained weights from ImageNet (if enabled)
        2. Modify first conv layer to accept custom input channels
        3. Apply weight morphing for channel compression (if grayscale)
        4. Replace classification head with dataset-specific linear layer
        5. Deploy model to target device (CUDA/MPS/CPU)

    Args:
        device: Target hardware for model placement
        num_classes: Number of dataset classes for classification head
        in_channels: Input channels (1=Grayscale, 3=RGB)
        cfg: Global configuration with pretrained/dropout settings

    Returns:
