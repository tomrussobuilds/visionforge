"""
Generic timm Backbone Builder.

Provides a universal builder for any model available in the timm
(PyTorch Image Models) registry. Delegates channel adaptation,
head replacement, and weight loading entirely to timm's native API.

Usage via YAML config:
    architecture:
      name: "timm/convnext_base.fb_in22k"
      pretrained: true
      dropout: 0.2

The ``timm/`` prefix is stripped by the factory before reaching this builder.

    Construct any timm-registered model with automatic adaptation.

    timm.create_model handles:
        - Pretrained weight loading (from HuggingFace Hub or torch.hub)
        - Classification head replacement (num_classes)
        - Input channel adaptation with weight morphing (in_chans)
        - Dropout rate injection (drop_rate)

    Args:
        device: Target hardware for model placement.
        num_classes: Number of output classes for the classification head.
        in_channels: Number of input channels (1=grayscale, 3=RGB).
        cfg: Global config with architecture.name, pretrained, dropout.

    Returns:
        Adapted timm model deployed to device.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the timm model identifier is not found in the registry.
