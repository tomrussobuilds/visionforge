**97.52% Test Accuracy • 0.9733 Macro F1 • Single pretrained ResNet-18 • 28×28 images**

This repository provides a reproducible training pipeline for the BloodMNIST (from MedMNIST v2) using an adapted pretrained ResNet-18 architecture. The goal is to demonstrate solid performance using a minimal configuration that adhere to modern PyTorch best practices.

### Final Results (42 Epochs via Early Stopping, seed 42)

The results reflect the latest successful training run (post-refactoring).

### Why this repo exists

I wanted to see how far a **single pretrained ResNet-18** could go on the tiny 28×28 BloodMNIST dataset with proper adaptation and modern training practices — no Ensembles, no ViTs, no custom backbones.

Spoiler: a carefully adapted ResNet-18 performs surprisingly well, even on 28×28 medical images.

### Training Efficiency Analysis

The training achieved peak validation performance at **Epoch 27** ($\text{Val Acc}=0.9720$) but was only terminated by early stopping at **Epoch 42**. This is due to the aggressive nature of the Cosine Annealing scheduler's tail combined with a generous `patience=15`.

**Analysis:** Epochs 28 through 36 (while Cosine Annealing was still active) did not contribute to the final result.

**Future Work:** The next step will focus on optimizing the training efficiency by anticipating the switch to the `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler (e.g., changing the switch point from 60% to 50% of max epochs) to reduce idle computation time.

### Key Features & Design Choices (Post-Refactoring)

The code has been cleanly separated into modulare components (`data_handler.py`, `models.py`,
`trainer.py`, `utils.py`) for enhaced clarity and maintainability.

- **ResNet-18 adapted for 28×28**:  
  – Initial 7 x7 convolution replaced with 3 x 3. 
  – Initial `MaxPool` removed to preserve 28 x 28 feature maps.
  – ImageNet pretrained weights transferred via bicubic upsampling of the first convolutional layer.
  – Reproduciblity & Robustness: – Full Reproducibility guaranteed (fixed seeds for PyTorch, NumPy, Python). – `worker_init_fn` implemented to ensure determinism even when using multiple data loading workers (`num_workers > 0).
  – Defensive Utilities: Robust dataset download with MD5 validation and atomic write ensures pipeline reliablity.

### The Small Utilities That Save Large Headaches

A few tiny helpers included in this repo were added after very real 5AM debugging incidents:

- **`get_base_dir()`** — ensures outputs never end up in unexpected system locations  
- **`kill_duplicate_processes()`** — stops accidental multi-launches that hog all RAM  
- **`ensure_mnist_npz()`** — safe dataset download with retries, MD5 check, and atomic write  
- Graceful process cleanup, checksum utilities, debug-safe file creation, etc.

They may look overkill, but they make the whole training pipeline safe to run unattended.

### Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

[📦 See Full Requirements](requirements.txt)


### Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomrussobuilds/bloodmnist.git
cd bloodmnist
python main.py
```
Note: The entry point script is now `main.py`.

The script will automatically:

- Download BloodMNIST if missing
- Train for max 60 epochs with early stopping (`patience=15`)
- Save the best model → `models/resnet18_bloodmnist_best.pth`
- Generate figures, confusion matrix, Excel report → `figures/` and `reports/`

### Command Line Arguments (argparse)
You can fully configure training from the command line (via `main.py`).

| Arg | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| --epochs | int | 60 | Maximum number of training epochs. |
| --batch_size | int | 128 | Batch size for data loaders. |
| --lr | float | 0.008 | Initial learning rate for the SGD optimizer. |
| --seed | int | 42 | Random seed for reproducibility (influences PyTorch, NumPy, Python). |
| --mixup_alpha | float | 0.002 | $\alpha$ parameter for MixUp regularization. Set to 0 to disable MixUp. |
| --patience | int | 15 | Early stopping patience (epochs without validation improvement). |
| --no_tta | flag | (disabled) | Flag to disable Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) during final evaluation. |

Examples:

Run without TTA

```bash
python main.py --no_tta
```
Train for 100 epochs

```bash
python main.py --epochs 100
```
Lower LR for finer tuning

```bash
python main.py --lr 0.001
```
Disable MixUp

```bash
python main.py --mixup_alpha 0
```
Custom batch size & seed

```bash
python main.py --barch_size 64 --seed 123
```

### Reproducibility

The entire pipeline is deterministic (seed 42). Run the script twice wille yield the same validation curve and the same final accuracy.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a classic, lightweight architecture like ResNet-18 can perform extremely well on a compact medical-image dataset when paired with a careful, modern training setup.

The goal is to provide a clean, stable, reproducible pipeline that others can reuse or extend with minimal friction.
