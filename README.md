### ✨ Key Features & Defensive Engineering

This pipeline is engineered for unattended, robust execution in research environments and containerized clusters. It moves beyond simple classification by implementing low-level system safeguards:

**Tiered Configuration Engine (SSOT)**: The pipeline core is a declarative, hierarchical manifest built on **Pydantic V2**. It acts as the **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**, transforming raw inputs into an immutable, type-safe execution blueprint. This engine provides:
* **Metadata Hydration**: Late-binding injection of dataset-specific specs (normalization constants, class mappings, channel counts) directly from a centralized registry.
* **Cross-Domain Validation**: Post-instantiation logic guards that prevent unstable states, such as enforcing 3-channel input for pretrained backbones or validating **AMP** (Automatic Mixed Precision) compatibility against hardware backends.
* **Path Portability**: Automated serialization of absolute filesystem paths into environment-agnostic anchors, ensuring experiment recipes are shareable across diverse clusters.

**Decentralized Infrastructure Guard**: Moving beyond simple automation, the system implements an independent `InfrastructureManager` that bridges the declarative config with physical hardware. This layer ensures:
* **Environment Mutual Exclusion**: Utilizes `fcntl` kernel-level advisory locking (via `flock`) to guarantee that only one training instance is active per workspace, preventing VRAM race conditions and checkpoint corruption.
* **Proactive Process Sanitization**: An intelligent `psutil` wrapper identifies and terminates ghost Python processes sharing the same entry point.
* **Cluster-Aware Safety**: Features a "Shared-Environment Detection" logic that automatically suspends process-killing routines when a scheduler (e.g., `SLURM`, `PBS`, `LSB`) is detected, preserving multi-user stability in HPC environments.

**Atomic Run Isolation**: Managed via the `RunPaths` utility, every execution generates a unique workspace (`outputs/YYYYMMDD_DS_MODEL_HASH/`). The system computes a deterministic **BLAKE2b** cryptographic hash (using a 3-byte digest for 6-hex characters) from the training configuration. This ensures that even slight hyperparameter variations result in isolated directories, preventing resource overlap and guaranteeing auditability.

**Data Integrity & Validation**: Implements `MD5` Checksum verification for dataset downloads and a strict `validate_npz_keys` check to ensure the structural integrity of the MedMNIST `.npz` files before memory allocation.

**Deterministic Pipeline**: Implements a dual-layer reproducibility strategy. Beyond global seeding (`Seed 42`), it features a Strict Mode that enforces bit-per-bit reproducibility by activating deterministic GPU kernels (`torch.use_deterministic_algorithms`) and synchronizing multi-process RNG via `worker_init_fn`, automatically scaling to zero workers when total determinism is required.

**System Utilities**: The `environment` module serves as a low-level abstraction layer that manages hardware device selection, ensures process-level atomicity through kernel-level file locking, and enforces strict environment-wide reproducibility.

**Continuous Stability Guard** (`smoke_test.py`): A dedicated diagnostic script that executes a "micro-pipeline" (1 epoch, minimal data subset). It validates the entire execution chain—from weight interpolation to Excel reporting—in less than 30 seconds, ensuring no regressions after architectural changes.

**Hybrid RAM Management**: Optimized for varying hardware constraints. The system automatically performs full RAM caching for smaller datasets to maximize throughput, while utilizing indexed slicing for massive datasets (like `TissueMNIST`) to prevent OOM (Out-of-Memory) errors.

**Dynamic Path Anchoring**: Leveraging a "Search-up" logic, the system dynamically locates the project root by searching for markers (`.git` or `README.md`). This ensures absolute path stability regardless of whether the script is launched from the root, `src/`, or a subfolder.

**Graceful Logger Reconfiguration**: Implements a two-stage logging lifecycle. Initial logs are routed to `STDOUT` for immediate feedback; once the `Orchestrator` initializes the run directory, the logger seamlessly hot-swaps to include a timestamped file handler without losing previous trace data.

### 🧩 Internal Dependency Mapping
The framework is designed with strict **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**. Below is the architectural graph showing the decoupling between the core engine, the data handlers, and the reporting silos.

### 🏗 Architecture Details

Standard ResNet-18 is designed for $224 \times 224$ inputs. When applied to the $28 \times 28$ MedMNIST manifold, the standard architecture suffers from aggressive information loss due to its initial downsampling layers. To preserve critical morphological details, the backbone has been modified:

| Layer | Standard ResNet-18 | Adapted ResNet-18 (Ours) | Adaptation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input Conv** | $7 \times 7$, stride 2, pad 3 | **$3 \times 3$, stride 1, pad 1** | Bicubic Weight Interpolation |
| **Max Pooling** | $3 \times 3$, stride 2 | **Bypassed (Identity)** | Maintain spatial resolution |
| **Stage 1 Input** | $56 \times 56$ (from 224) | **$28 \times 28$ (from 28)** | Preserve native resolution |



**Key Modifications:**
1.  **Stem Adaptation**: The initial large-receptive-field convolution is replaced with a $3 \times 3$ kernel. By setting `stride=1`, we avoid losing 75% of the pixel data in the first layer.
2.  **Downsampling Removal**: The initial MaxPool layer is bypassed. In a standard ResNet, the feature map would be reduced to $14 \times 14$ before even reaching the first residual block. Our adaptation enters the residual stages at the full $28 \times 28$ resolution.
3.  **Bicubic Weight Transfer**: To maintain the representational power of the ImageNet-pretrained backbone, weights from the original $7 \times 7$ stem are mapped to the adapted $3 \times 3$ geometry using bicubic interpolation. This ensures the model starts with learned feature detectors rather than random noise.

---

### 🔬 Mathematical Weight Transfer

To retain the representational power of the pretrained backbone, we do not initialize the new $3 \times 3$ kernel randomly. Instead, we perform a spatial transformation on the weight tensor:

**Source Tensor**: Pretrained ImageNet weights 

$$W_{src} \in \mathbb{R}^{C_{out} \times C_{in} \times 7 \times 7}$$

**Interpolation**: Application of a bicubic resizing function $f$ across spatial dimensions:

$$W_{dest} = f(W_{src}, \text{size}=(3, 3))$$

**Result**: A $3 \times 3$ kernel that preserves the edge-detection patterns learned on ImageNet but optimized for a tighter receptive field.

Note: This process ensures that the model starts training with "meaningful" filters rather than noise, leading to faster convergence and higher accuracy on small-scale medical textures.

---

### 🔬 Training Regularization

To improve generalization on the $28 \times 28$ manifold, the pipeline implements MixUp during training. New samples are synthesized as a convex combination of two random samples from the mini-batch:

$$
\tilde{x} = \lambda x_i + (1 - \lambda) x_j
$$
$$
\tilde{y} = \lambda y_i + (1 - \lambda) y_j
$$

Where $\lambda \in [0, 1]$ is drawn from a $\text{Beta}(\alpha, \alpha)$ distribution.

### ⚙️ Requirements & Installation


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install dependencies easily with pip, or check the full list here:

[📦 See Full Requirements](requirements.txt)


### 💻 Usage (Local)

#### Option A: Running with a Recipe (Recommended)

This is the preferred way to ensure full reproducibility. The YAML file acts as the Single Source of Truth (SSOT).

```bash
# Ensure PYTHONPATH is set
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)

# Launch using the configuration recipe
python main.py --config recipes/config.yaml
```

#### Option B: Standard CLI (Quick Tests)

```bash
python main.py --dataset dermamnist --epochs 10
```

> [!TIP] 
> When `--config` is provided, the `YAML` file takes precedence over `CLI` arguments to prevent configuration drift.
---

### ✅ Environment Verification (Smoke Test)

Before starting a full training session, it is highly recommended to run the diagnostic smoke test. This ensures that your local environment, PyTorch versions, and visualization libraries are fully compatible:

```bash
python -m tools.smoke_test
```

This will run a 1-epoch training on a tiny subset of a MedMNIST dataset and verify the generation of all output files.

---

### 🐳 Docker Execution (Recommended for Portability)

The pipeline is containerized using the included `Dockerfile`.

Build the image locally using the provided Dockerfile. This ensures all dependencies and environment are correctly configured.

```bash
sudo docker build -t bloodmnist_image .
```

**Run Experiments**

You can choose between Strict Reproducibility (for testing/validation) and Standard Mode (for performance).

Option A: Strict Reproducibility Mode (Deterministic) Enforces bit-perfect results by disabling multi-processing and forcing deterministic GPU kernels.

```bash
sudo docker run -it --rm \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -e IN_DOCKER=TRUE \
  -e DOCKER_REPRODUCIBILITY_MODE=TRUE \
  -e TORCH_HOME=/tmp/torch_cache \
  -e MPLCONFIGDIR=/tmp/matplotlib_cache \
  -e PYTHONHASHSEED=42 \
  -e CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8 \
  -v $(pwd)/dataset:/app/dataset \
  -v $(pwd)/outputs:/app/outputs \
  bloodmnist_image --dataset bloodmnist
```

Option B: Standard Mode (High Performance) Optimized for training speed using multi-core data loading and standard algorithms.

```bash
sudo docker run -it --rm \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -e IN_DOCKER=TRUE \
  -e TORCH_HOME=/tmp/torch_cache \
  -e MPLCONFIGDIR=/tmp/matplotlib_cache \
  -v $(pwd)/dataset:/app/dataset \
  -v $(pwd)/outputs:/app/outputs \
  bloodmnist_image --dataset pathmnist --batch_size 256
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The flags `-e TORCH_HOME=/tmp/torch_cache` and `-e MPLCONFIGDIR=/tmp/matplotlib_cache` are mandatory when running with a specific user ID (`-u`) to avoid `Permission Denied` errors in the container's root filesystem.
> The `CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG` is also required for bit-perfect `CUDA` determinism.

### 🗺 Research Goals & Roadmap

- **Phase 1: Architecture Optimization (Completed)** Implementation of kernel stem resizing ($3 \times 3$) and MaxPool removal to preserve critical morphological details on the $28 \times 28$ MedMNIST manifold.

- **Phase 2: Configuration-Driven Engine (Completed)** Transition to a fully declarative execution model using **YAML Recipes**. Total decoupling of experiment logic from the core engine for version-controlled, reproducible research.

- **Phase 3: High-Resolution & Modern Backbones (Near Term)** Scaling the pipeline to handle high-resolution inputs ($224 \times 224$ and beyond). Integration of state-of-the-art architectures including **Vision Transformers (ViT)**, **EfficientNet-V2**, and **ConvNeXt** to benchmark global vs. local feature extraction.

- **Phase 4: Domain Transcendence & Universal Framework (Long Term)** Evolving the codebase into a domain-agnostic Computer Vision framework. This includes abstracting the Data Registry to support diverse manifolds (Natural Images, Satellite, Industrial Inspection) and implementing multi-modal hooks for broader vision tasks.
