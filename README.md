**97.19% Test Accuracy • 0.9693 Macro F1 • Single pretrained ResNet-18 • 28×28 images**

This repository provides a highly reproducible training pipeline for the BloodMNIST (from MedMNIST v2) using an adapted pretrained ResNet-18 architecture. The goal is to demonstrate solid performance using a minimal configuration that adheres to modern PyTorch best practices.

The results reflect the latest successful training run (early stopping at epoch 44).

### Why this repo exists

I wanted to see how far a **single pretrained ResNet-18** could go on the tiny 28×28 BloodMNIST dataset with proper adaptation and modern training practices — no Ensembles, no ViTs, no custom backbones.

Spoiler: a carefully adapted ResNet-18 performs surprisingly well, even on 28×28 medical images.

### Key Features & Design Choices (Post-Refactoring)

- **Modularity and Structure**: Code has been separated into clean, modular components (`scripts/`) to enforce single responsibility principle and decouple execution (`main.py`) from business logic.
- **Robust Pathing**: Implemented dynamic `PROJECT_ROOT` detection in `utils.py` to ensure all outputs (models, logs, figures) are correctly saved relative to the project root, regardless of where the script is executed (local or Docker container).
- **Accuracy vs. Reproducibility Balance**: **The pipeline prioritizes fully deterministic reproducibility.** While running in "Fast Mode" (`num_workers > 0`) is faster, the "Strict Reproducibility" mode (`num_workers=0`) guarantees bit-per-bit identical results at the expense of a longer training time. This trade-off is managed automatically via `DOCKER_REPRODUCIBILITY_MODE` environment variable.

### ResNet-18 adapted for 28×28
- Initial 7 x7 convolution replaced with 3 x 3.
- Initial `MaxPool` removed to preserve 28 x 28 feature maps.
- ImageNet pretrained weights transferred via bicubic upsampling of the first convolutional layer.
- Reproduciblity & Robustness: – Full Reproducibility guaranteed (fixed seeds for PyTorch, NumPy, Python).
- `worker_init_fn` implemented to ensure determinism even when using multiple data loading workers (`num_workers > 0`).
- Defensive Utilities: Robust dataset download with MD5 validation and atomic write ensures pipeline reliablity.

---

### Defensive Utilities

A few tiny helpers included in `utils.py` were added after real debugging incidents to ensure robust, unattended execution:

* **Dynamic `num_workers`:** The `Config` class automatically adjusts `num_workers` (0 vs 4) based on the `DOCKER_REPRODUCIBILITY_MODE` environment variable, balancing speed and determinism.
* **Process Management (`kill_duplicate_processes()`):** Stops accidental multi-launches that consume excessive CPU/RAM.
* **Safe Data I/O (`ensure_mnist_npz()`):** Robust dataset download with retries, MD5 check, and atomic write ensures pipeline reliability.
* **Robust Pathing:** The `get_base_dir()` utility ensures all outputs (models, logs, figures) are saved correctly relative to the project root, regardless of the execution environment (host or Docker).

### 2. Usage (Local Execution - Recommended for Speed)

Run the script from the project root. It will default to the fast mode (`num_workers=4`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomrussobuilds/bloodmnist.git
cd bloodmnist
python main.py
```
Note: The entry point script is now `main.py`.

The script will automatically:

- Download BloodMNIST if missing
- Train for max 60 epochs with early stopping (`patience=15`)
- Save the best model → `models/resnet18_bloodmnist_best.pth`
- Generate figures, confusion matrix, Excel report → `figures/` and `reports/`

### 3. Docker Execution (Recommended for Portability & Reproducibility)

The pipeline is containerized using the included `Dockerfile`.

| Mode | Command | `num_workers` | Guarantees |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Fast Mode (Default)** | `docker run bloodmnist_image` | 4 | Best performance on CPU, **Not fully deterministic** |
| **Strict Reproducibility** | `-e DOCKER_REPRODUCIBILITY_MODE=TRUE` | 0 | **100% Deterministic** (bit-per-bit), but slower |

Run in Strict Reproducibility Mode (Recommended for testing):

```bash
docker run -it --rm -e DOCKER_REPRODUCIBILITY_MODE=TRUE bloodmnist_image
```

### Command Line Arguments (argparse)
You can fully configure training from the command line (via `main.py`).

| Arg | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| --epochs | int | 60 | Maximum number of training epochs. |
| --batch_size | int | 128 | Batch size for data loaders. |
| --lr | float | 0.008 | Initial learning rate for the SGD optimizer. |
| --seed | int | 42 | Random seed for reproducibility (influences PyTorch, NumPy, Python). |
| --mixup_alpha | float | 0.002 | $\alpha$ parameter for MixUp regularization. Set to 0 to disable MixUp. |
| --patience | int | 15 | Early stopping patience (epochs without validation improvement). |
| --momentum | float | 0.9 | Momentum factor for the SGD optimizer. |
| --weight_decay | float | 5e-4 | Weight decay (L2 penalty) for the optimizer |
| --no_tta | flag | (disabled) | Flag to disable Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) during final evaluation. |

Examples:

Run without TTA

```bash
python main.py --no_tta
```
Train for 100 epochs

```bash
python main.py --epochs 100
```
Lower LR for finer tuning

```bash
python main.py --lr 0.001
```
Disable MixUp

```bash
python main.py --mixup_alpha 0
```
Custom batch size & seed

```bash
python main.py --batch_size 64 --seed 123
```

### Reproducibility

The entire pipeline is deterministic (seed 42). Run the script twice will yield the same validation curve and the same final accuracy.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a classic, lightweight architecture like ResNet-18 can perform extremely well on a compact medical-image dataset when paired with a careful, modern training setup.

The goal is to provide a clean, stable, reproducible pipeline that others can reuse or extend with minimal friction.
