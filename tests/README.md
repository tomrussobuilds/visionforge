<h2>Testing & Quality Assurance</h2>

<h3>Test Suite</h3>

Orchard ML includes a comprehensive test suite with **1,100+ tests** targeting **100% code coverage**:

```bash
# Run full test suite
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=orchard --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/ -m unit          # Unit tests only
pytest tests/ -m integration   # Integration tests only

# Run parallel tests (faster)
pytest tests/ -n auto
```

<h3>Test Categories</h3>

- **Unit Tests** (~950 tests): Config validation, metadata injection, type safety
- **Integration Tests** (~150 tests): End-to-end pipeline validation, YAML hydration
- **Smoke Tests**: 1-epoch sanity checks (~30 seconds)
- **Health Checks**: Dataset integrity verification

<h3>Continuous Integration</h3>

GitHub Actions automatically run on every push:

- ✅ **Code Quality**: Black, isort, Flake8 formatting and linting checks
- ✅ **Multi-Python Testing**: Unit tests across Python 3.10–3.14 (1,100+ tests)
- ✅ **Smoke Test**: 1-epoch end-to-end validation (~30s, CPU-only)
- ✅ **Documentation**: README.md presence verification
- ✅ **Security Scanning**: Bandit (code analysis) and pip-audit (dependency vulnerabilities)
- ✅ **Code Coverage**: Automated reporting to Codecov (99%+ coverage)

**Pipeline Status:**

| Job | Description | Status |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| **Code Quality** | Black, isort, Flake8 | Continue-on-error (advisory) |
| **Pytest Suite** | ~1,100 tests, 5 Python versions | ✅ Required to pass |
| **Smoke Test** | 1-epoch E2E validation | ✅ Required to pass |
| **Documentation** | README verification | ✅ Required to pass |
| **Security Scan** | Bandit + pip-audit | Continue-on-error (advisory) |
| **Build Status** | Aggregate summary | ✅ Fails if pytest or smoke test fails |

> **Note**: Health checks are not run in CI to avoid excessive dataset downloads. Run locally with `python -m tests.health_check` for dataset integrity validation.

<h3>Additional CI/CD Workflows</h3>

Beyond the main CI pipeline, the project includes automated release and publishing workflows:

| Workflow | Trigger | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **CI/CD** (`ci.yml`) | Every push/PR | Full test suite, code quality, smoke test, security scan |
| **Badges** (`badges.yml`) | Push to main | Updates dynamic quality badges (Black, isort, Flake8, mypy, Radon) |
| **Release** (`release.yml`) | Tag push (`v*`) | Creates GitHub Release with auto-generated changelog (git-cliff) |
| **Publish** (`publish.yml`) | Tag push (`v*`) | Builds and publishes package to PyPI via Trusted Publisher |

**Release process:**
```bash
# Tag a new version and push to trigger release + publish
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
# → GitHub Release created automatically with changelog
# → Package built and published to PyPI
```
